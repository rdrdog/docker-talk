# 03 - dockerfile is the build

Here we have a dockerfile for a node application. Each step in the dockerfile is essentially a build stage of our application.
Open the Dockerfile and read through the comments to learn more.

As with our other dockerfiles, we can build this with:

```
docker build .
```
